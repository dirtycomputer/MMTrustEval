# Data Preparation for MultiTrust

Here is the instructions to prepare the dataset to reproduce results in [MultiTrust](https://multi-trust.github.io).


## Download Data

## Partial Release
Please note that only a part of datasets are released for now, because we are hosting a competition based on some proposed tasks in [MultiTrust](https://multi-trust.github.io) and need to avoid the leakage of test data. The complete version will be released after the competition. 

Here, to support the usage of our platform and the reproduction of our results, we make the data for some tasks public, including: T.1 (Basic World Understanding), T.7 (Visual Misleading QA), S.3 (Toxicity Content Generation), S.4 (Plain Typographic Jailbreaking), R.1 (VQA for Artistic Style Images), R.6 (Textual Adversarial Attack), F.6 (Profession Prediction), F.7 (Preference Selection in QA), P.3 (InfoFlow Expectation) and P.4 (PII Query with Visual Cues). 

## Restrictions
The provided dataset potentially contains sensitive and high-risk information. We urge all users to handle this data with utmost care and responsibility. Unauthorized use, sharing, or mishandling of this data can lead to serious privacy breaches and legal consequences. By accessing this dataset, you agree to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, and to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data from unauthorized access or misuse.
