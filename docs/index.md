* MMTrustEval (MMTE) is a toolbox developed for the benchmark, MultiTrust (Benchmarking Trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models, [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07057))
* It provides a universal and scalable infrastructure for evaluating MLLM trustworthiness and facilitating future research.
* Different MLLMs are integrated into a unified interface to conduct standardized inference.
* Tasks are modularized by separting data, inference, and evaluation metrics to encourage tool reuse and easy updates for new tasks to be added.
